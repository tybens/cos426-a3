# This file was generated for the student.

# For information on YAML, see: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#chapter-2-language-overview

# YAML strings can be unquoted, quoted with single quotes, or quoted with
# double quotes. The type of quoting matters if you have special characters in
# the string, such as ":" or "#". To avoid ambiguity, we will use "block
# scalar" strings for `description_html`, `link`, and `caption_html`, in which
# the string starts on the next line and you can put any character you want.
# For more information, see: https://yaml-multiline.info/

# In `description_html` and `caption_html`, feel free to use HTML tags as you
# wish. These will show up as-is in `writeup.html`.

# Please fill in your name and NetID
# Your NetID is the part of your email before "@princeton.edu"
